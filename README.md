# KingMeeps

This project is for the KingMeeps video game.

This is a checkers themed game. Players will be able to play against one another online or against the A.I.

Checker pieces have hidden attributes that players assign during their turn. Attributes may have limited duration.

Animation sequence will occur when a checker piece with a hidden attribute jumps another player, or is jumped by the opposing player.

The initial build of this game will be using JavaScript.
